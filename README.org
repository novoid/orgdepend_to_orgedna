* org-depend_to_org-edna

This is a utility tool to convert [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] files from [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-depend.html][org-depend]] to
[[https://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/][org-edna]]. Both packages are methods to define dependencies between
todo tasks. The latter one is more advanced and therefore has a more
complicated syntax.

You might be interested in following blog articles of mine:
- [[https://karl-voit.at/2016/12/18/org-depend][UOMF: Advanced Usage of Dependencies Between Tasks Using Org Mode]] (covers org-depend)
- [[https://karl-voit.at/2020/08/14/project-mgt-draft][A Draft Workflow for Advanced Project Management Using Org Mode and Org Edna]] (covers org-edna)

This is *just a one-shot "works-for-me" script* with a *limited set of
support* for the org-depend syntax I was using in my own files. Please
take a look at the test cases in order to get an overview what
properties are understood and converted.

** Instructions

1. This tool needs [[http://www.python.org/downloads/][Python 3 to be installed]].
2. Download the repository from GitHub. FIXXME: Repository URL
3. Execute the unit tests in order to check if it is working in your
   environment.
   - Please note that the unit tests are not exhaustive, covering only
     a minimum set of conversion functionality.
4. Apply on your Org mode files.
5. *Check the result file* using a diff-tool like [[https://meldmerge.org/][meld]] before
   replacing the original file with the modified output of this tool.
